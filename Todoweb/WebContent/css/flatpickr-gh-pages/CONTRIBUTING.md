Thank you for your interest in contributing to this library!

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker on GitHub is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature
requests, and submitting pull requests about this project.

## Pull requests

If you submit a pull request that changes source code, please run a build
before submitting so that your pull request also includes the built code.
To set up the build, run `npm install` on the command line from the directory
containing the library's code. This will install software (listed in
`package.json` if you want to check) which is used to perform the build.
Once you do this, you will not need to do it again. To upgrade these
developer dependencies, run `npm update`.

To run a build, just run `gulp` on the command line from the directory
containing the extension's code. If you'd like a build to run any time you
change a source code file, run `gulp watch` and it will run in the
background.
